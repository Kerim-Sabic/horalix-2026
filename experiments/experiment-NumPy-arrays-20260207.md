# Experiment: NumPy arrays

**Date:** 2026-02-07 22:15
**Context:** Adding new functionality
**Status:** 🧪 In Progress

## Hypothesis

NumPy arrays can reduce processing time by at least 30%.

## Setup

```bash
# Setup commands for NumPy arrays
npm init -y
npm install numpy
```

## Code

```javascript
// Experiment with NumPy arrays
const result = await testNumPyarrays();
console.log('Result:', result);
```

## Observations

- Some edge cases need to be handled more gracefully.
- Initial results show promise but need more testing.

## Conclusion

TBD - Need more testing
