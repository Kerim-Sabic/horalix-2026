**Context:** Fixing issues
**Status:** 🧪 In Progress

## Hypothesis

Node.js streams approach is more suitable for this use case than alternatives.

## Setup

```bash
# Setup commands for Node.js streams
npm init -y
npm install node.js
```

## Code

```javascript
// Experiment with Node.js streams
const result = await testNode.jsstreams();
console.log('Result:', result);
```

## Observations

- Integration with existing system was smoother than anticipated.
- Performance is better than expected under light load.

## Conclusion

TBD - Need more testing
